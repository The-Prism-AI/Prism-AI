About us: 

We started Prism, with the aim to revolutionize the developer and user experience in AI. With an extensive library of tools for information integration and retrieval, Prism enables app developers to incorporate Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and AI into their applications quickly, without having to hire experts or host their own systems. Whether you’re an expert or just getting started with language models, we enable you to easily tap into the expansive potential of your ideas.

What is Retrieval Augmented Generation? 

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a method for retrieving information from a knowledge source, and using it to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT or Claude. RAG allows you to “plug in” knowledge from your files, websites, or cloud storage, and use it to enhance the text generated by your favorite LLMs.

Suppose you want to build an AI legal expert, a Research Assistant with all the up-to-date knowledge of your scientific field, a chat-bot to help users navigate your website, or you’re just tired of hearing “I'm unable to provide real-time information because my knowledge was last updated in September 2021”: Prism’s powerful RAG API will provide you with the tools you need to build a high-performing system, quickly.

The Future of RAG: Beyond Vector Embeddings Databases
In the realm of information retrieval and AI language models, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful approach to enhance the capabilities of large language models. RAG allows developers to integrate knowledge from various sources, such as databases, websites, and files, to enrich the text generated by AI models like ChatGPT or Claude. While vector embeddings have traditionally played a crucial role in RAG systems, it is important to explore the limitations and challenges associated with this approach and consider alternative solutions for the future.

The Power of Vector Embeddings: Vector embeddings have been widely used in RAG systems due to their ability to capture the semantic meaning of words and phrases. By transforming text into high-dimensional numerical representations, vector embeddings enable AI models to compare and identify similar information more effectively. This has proven useful in tasks such as document search, question-answering, and chatbots, where understanding context and retrieving relevant information are key.

Key Challenges with Vector Embeddings for RAG Systems:

Limited Semantic Understanding: While vector embeddings excel at capturing similarities between words and phrases, they struggle to recognize relationships between named entities or complex concepts. This hinders their ability to generate contextually appropriate responses and limits their understanding of specific domains.

Lack of Entity Relationship Awareness: Vector embeddings do not possess an inherent understanding of the relationship between named entities. For example, they may not recognize that "Barack Obama" is a person and "US President" is a related position. This lack of explicit knowledge can lead to suboptimal results when producing responses that require a deep understanding of entities and their connections.

Difficulty in Adapting to Changing Knowledge: Vector embeddings rely on pre-trained models that may not be up-to-date with the latest information. The inability to easily update embeddings with new knowledge poses a challenge for RAG systems that require real-time and accurate responses based on the most recent data.

Alternative Approaches to Enhance RAG Systems: While vector embeddings have been a cornerstone of RAG systems, alternative approaches are emerging to overcome the limitations mentioned above:

Knowledge Graph Integration: Integrating knowledge graphs into RAG systems can provide a structured representation of information along with explicit relationships between entities. This enables AI models to leverage graph-based algorithms and reasoning to improve context awareness and generate more accurate and coherent responses.


Real-time Knowledge Updates: Building systems that support real-time knowledge updates is essential for applications that require up-to-date information. Integrating data streams and mechanisms for continuous learning can ensure that RAG systems remain relevant and accurate even as new knowledge becomes available.

Simple Keyword Search: While vector embeddings and knowledge graphs provide a nuanced understanding of information, simple keyword search remains a powerful approach to retrieve relevant documents. By incorporating keyword-based retrieval techniques, RAG systems can effectively handle cases where specific keywords are crucial for accurate retrieval.


HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings): HyDE is an approach that leverages hypothetical document embeddings for semantic search. It generates a hypothetical answer to a query using a language model and embeds it into a vector space. By comparing the vector representation of hypothetical documents with real documents, HyDE improves the relevance and precision of document retrieval, even when exact search terms are not present.


Hybrid Approaches: Hybrid approaches aim to combine multiple techniques, such as vector embeddings, knowledge graphs, keyword search, and HyDE, into a unified framework. By leveraging the strengths of different methods, hybrid models offer more comprehensive and accurate retrieval capabilities, enhancing the overall performance of RAG systems.

While vector embeddings have been instrumental in advancing RAG systems, it is essential to recognize their limitations and explore alternative approaches for future development. By incorporating knowledge graphs, hybrid models, and real-time knowledge updates, RAG systems can overcome existing challenges and provide more contextually aware and accurate AI-generated responses. As the field continues to evolve, the future of RAG lies in embracing these advancements and pushing the boundaries of AI-powered information retrieval and generation.
