1) Clone the Git repo into some location. 

2) cd Prism-AI

3) Set your api_key as an environment variable. Right now it is pointing at the test-system. You can use root super admin key: 

in bash: export PRISM_API_KEY=rs_aebbc1d1fbcf1478369d89e722d1bd6643bb8e40e712335cb3d0ae6bb1ce29d8be969f887b

4) enter a python shell 

5) Here are the commands to enter for the demo video: 

import prism_ai as pai 

kb = pai.KnowledgeBase.create(
    name = "Corporate Policy Training Documents", 
    base_dir = "./Corporate/Policy/Files/"
)

### Wait here a little bit for context to be computed ... I guess we can chop the wait time when editing the video? 

pai.Reply.stream(
    prompt="Can you summarize our corporate policy regarding data security and protection of sensitive information?",
    knowledge_base=[kb.id]
)

knowledge = pai.Knowledge.create(
    method = "url", 
    name = "Prism AI about page", 
    knowledge_base_id = kb.id, 
    url = "https://www.prism-ai.ch/about/"
)

### No need to wait here, this will just pretend to create a url context for the video. It already pulled everything it needed from the files. 

pai.Reply.stream(
    prompt="Can you tell me a bit about Prism and what they do?",
    knowledge_base=[kb.id]
)

pai.Reply.stream(
    prompt="Is Prism compatible with our corporate policy on data security?",
    knowledge_base=[kb.id]
)

pai.KnowledgeBase.add(
     id=kb.id,
     name = "Internal Drives",
     method = "drive_integration",
     drive = ["https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive/"]
)

pai.Reply.stream(
    prompt="Tell me about the files I mounted from google drive.",
    knowledge_base=[kb.id]
)
